# Supercapacitor Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict the performance of supercapacitor electrode materials. Developed as my final-year project in Materials Engineering at KNUST, it demonstrates how AI and data-driven modeling can assist in materials discovery and characterization.

## 📌 Project Overview

Supercapacitors are gaining traction due to their fast charge-discharge capability and long cycle life. However, experimental testing of new electrode materials is time-consuming. This project proposes a predictive model that estimates specific capacitance based on material properties and fabrication conditions using machine learning techniques.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Git & GitHub

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Data Collection: Gathered experimental data on electrode materials and their electrochemical performance.
2. Preprocessing: Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and normalized features.
3. Model Development:
   - XGBoost Regressor
   
4. Evaluation: Measured performance using metrics such as R² Score, MAE, and RMSE.

## 📊 Results

- **XGBoost Model**:  
Model Performance Metrics:
Training MSE: 1062.23
Testing MSE: 1776.43
Training R² Score: 0.86
Testing R² Score: 0.77
